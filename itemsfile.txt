== Item Database Format ==
(Simple Version)

Each line denotes a "slot"
	<system>\t<code>\t<price>\t<description>
Comments are denoted by '#' or ';' (with # usually being for info comments
and ; for commenting out)
comments are allowed anywhere on a line and act until the end of the line.


For example, a coke could be
	drink	06	96	Coke
A pseudo-item could be
	pseudo	01	10	Laserprint
Or a snack
	snack	64	128	Mars Bar

The <system> denotes what controller plugin to use for the item.
Currently there are only three:
 "drink" is the drinks machine
 "pseudo" is essentially a no-op, no action is taken on dispense (save
 for logging)
 "snack" controls the snack machine, dropping an item on dispense
